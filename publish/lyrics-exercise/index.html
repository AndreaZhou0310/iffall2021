            <p>We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January</p>
            <p>And this is our place, we make the rules</p>
            <p>And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear</p>
            <p>Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?</p>
            <br>
            <span class="Chorus">
            <p>Can I go where you go?</p>
            <p>Can we always be this close forever and ever?</p>
            <p>And ah, take me out, and take me home</p>
            <span class="Lover">
            <p>You're my, my, my, my</p>
            <p>Lover</p>
            </span>
            </span>
            <br>
            <p>We could let our friends crash in the living room</p>
            <p>This is our place, we make the call</p>
            <p>And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you</p>
            <p>I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all</p>
            <br>
            <span class="Chorus">
            <p>Can I go where you go?</p>
            <p>Can we always be this close forever and ever?</p>
            <p>And ah, take me out, and take me home <span class="chord">(forever and ever)</span></p>
            <span class="Lover">
            <p>You're my, my, my, my</p>
            <p>Lover</p>
            </span>
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?</p>
            <p>With every guitar string scar on my hand</p>
            <p>I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover</p>
            <p>My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue</p>
            <p>All's well that ends well to end up with you</p>
            <p>Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover</p>
            <p>And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me</p>
            <p>And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover</p>
            <br>
            <span class="Chorus">
            <p>Can I go where you go?</p>
            <p>Can we always be this close forever and ever?</p>
            <p>And ah, take me out, and take me home <span class="chord">(forever and ever)</span></p>
            <span class="Lover">
            <p>You're my, my, my, my</p>
            <p>Oh, you're my, my, my, my</p>
            <p>Darling, you're my, my, my, my</p>
            <p>Lover</p>
