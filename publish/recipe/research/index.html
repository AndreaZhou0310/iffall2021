      <h1>Basque Burnt Cheesecake</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This cheesecake is the alter ego to the classic New York–style cheesecake with a press-in cookie crust. Inspired by a Basque version, this is the cheesecake that wants to get burnt, cracked, and cooked at high heat. Which also means this is the cheesecake that’s impossible to mess up.</p>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>

        <b>Step 1</b>
        <p>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won’t end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that’s okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.</p>

        <b>Step 2</b>
        <p>Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.</p>

        <b>Step 3</b>
        <p>Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.</p>

        <b>Step 4</b>
        <p>Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.</p>

        <b>Step 5</b>
        <p>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.</p>

        <b>Step 6</b>
        <p>Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.</p>
        <p><b>Do Ahead:</b> Cheesecake be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to remove chill before serving.</p>

                    <p>There is a very good use of the grid system to pact the most useful information in a rectangle so that viewers are able to get most information without much scrolling. Also, it is interactive in that viewers are able to check and uncheck the ingredients. The use of the red color highlights the buttons for users to save the recipe or to share.</p>

                    <p>A very clear hierarchy is established through mainly the change in the font choices and text sizes. I like how frames and colors are used to create sections, making it a lot easier for users to read and skim through.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy how interactive the website is. There is a list of items towards the top of the page that are linked to specific portions. Users are able to check what ingredients that they have prepared and which steps that have been done.</p>

                    <p>The use of negative space and icons are brilliant. The colors act as dividers to separate out different sections without making the composition too rigid.</p>

                    <p>I like how objects appear and fade out as viewers are scrolling through. I think that it can be applied to show the steps in the instruction.</p>

                    <p>I like how the images automatically changes to show the different ingredients. Also, the use of different types effectively draws viewers' attention.</p>
