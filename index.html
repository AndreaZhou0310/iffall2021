        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>My name is <b>Andrea Zhou</b>. I am a <b>junior</b>, majoring in <b>Communication Design</b> 
                and Finance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With a second major in business, I know how important communication and user experience are.
            I am very interested in grphic design and as the world is going digital, I am expecting to do 
            website or app designs in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No, I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I hope to learn designing a simple game. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>One way that designing for screen is different from designing for paper is that designers 
                need to accomodate for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MOMA</a>
                <p>The MOMA website exemplifies effective design as the overall design exhibits a consistent 
                    style with the branding of the museum, with the colors reflecting different exhibits on 
                    show. There is a good balance between static and dynamic elements and the navigation bar 
                    always sticks on the top for user convenience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a>
                <p>The Sephora website exemplifies effective communication as there is a very clear navigation 
                    bar that helps direct consumers to the specific product catergories desired. Action items, 
                    like the shopping cart and the sign in function is separated out from the products. In the 
                    product listing pages, more information is shown when customers hover over the image. 
                    Promotions and new collections are highlighed in the banners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>
                <p>The linkedin website works well because the space is divided up very efficiently in to three 
                    panels. Each panel has a clear function and hierarchies defined by using scale, size, value 
                    and color. It is easy to find information, make posts, and go to external links.
